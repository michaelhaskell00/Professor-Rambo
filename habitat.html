        <h1>Professor Rambo's Planet</h1>
        <p>Professor Rambo is from a planet called Vortex 1214b located 130 billion light-years away from Earth. This planet can't be reached at this point by Earth because our understanding of the observable universe only goes up to 40-93 billion light-years. This planet is special because there are rivers that go in multiple directions. Instead of waterfalls, this planet has "water-rises." There are oceans that go as deep as 4-5 million feet deep, creating an exotic ice known as ICE 7. It rains sideways on the dark side and it orbits 3 stars, causes anyone there to have 3 shadows. This planet is extremely futuristic and technologically advance compared to Earth. Wireless communication, like Bluetooth or NFC, is already incorporated into the brain of civilians on this planet. Giving them capabilities to connect and process things like a CPU chipset. People can travel in a ship much faster than the speed of light, enabling Professor Rambo to get to Earth in no time.</p>
