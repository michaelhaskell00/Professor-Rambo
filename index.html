        <p>This is Professor Rambo. He is a wickedly smart villain. This is what you would call, a semi-human with special capabilities. He may look like a human, but he sure is more capable than one. With his super strength, super powers, and just being super smart, he is someone that can achieve unbelievable things. Due to him being a villain, he can cause a lot of destruction if he wanted to do so. Beware!</p>
