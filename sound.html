        <p>Professor Rambo lives in an environment like New York City. Just think of New York City today with its modern skyscrapers and rapid transit, but times it by 50. Rambo is into Electronic Dance Music and anything with Artifical Intelligence. He resides in a luxurious penthouse with his pet poodle named Irony.</p>


        <p>The weather conditions are very strange and much more unsual than Earth. The weather can be very hot to very cold. Vortex 1214b orbits 3 stars, which are about the size of our Sun. Because of this, the Summer months can reach a sweltering 1200 degrees F. Surprisingly, the Winter months can dip as low as -179 degrees F, which makes water as hard as rocks. Crazy, right?</p>

        <p>Where Rambo lives can be noisy, like New York City. Notice how I keep comparing Rambo's environment to New York City. When he's outside, he will hear engine noises, constant chattering from people, msuic playing, and the sound of "water-rises." It can be distracting, but luckily for him, his penthouse can isolate him from the ambient noise. Indoors, he will hear his poodle barking at times, his favorite EDM tracks playing, and a soothing background sound of rain or the ocean playing from his surround sound speaker system.</p>
