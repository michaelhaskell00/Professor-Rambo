        <h1>Professor Rambo's Planet</h1>
        <p>Professor Rambo is from a planet called Vortex 1214b located 130 billion light-years away from Earth. This planet can't be reached at this point by Earth because our understanding of the observable universe only goes up to 46-93 billion light-years. This planet is special because there are rivers that go in multiple directions in an odd way. Instead of waterfalls, this planet has "water-rises," gravity just being plain weird. There are oceans that go as deep as 100's of kilometers (4-5 million feet deep), creating an exotic ice known as ICE 7 due to the extreme amount of water pressure. It rains sideways on the dark side due to 4,800 mph winds and it orbits 3 stars, causing anyone there to deal with 500-600 degree temperatures, but also amazingly have 3 shadows. This planet is extremely futuristic and technologically advance compared to Earth. Wireless communication, like Bluetooth or NFC, is already incorporated into the brain of civilians on this planet. Giving them capabilities to connect and process things like Apple's latest A15 Bionic chipset. Professor Rambo, however, does stick out from the crowd. Being far superior in every way, with his powers and the planet having super advance technlogy. His habitat gave him so much influence, but manages to be a rare figure in a place that is already unbelievably superior compared to Earth!</p>
