			<h1>More About Rambo</h1>
			<p>Professor Rambo may look like a human, but he definitely is an unusual person in many ways.<br> His physical and emotional traits can be somewhat relatable or shocking.<br></p> 
            <h2>Physical Traits</h2>
			<p>Rambo is 9 feet tall. This would make him the tallest man on Earth. He's even one of the tallest on Vortex 1214b due to the average height of a male being 7 and a half feet tall. More shocking than his height is his weight. He weighs 1,520 lbs, heavier than the heaviest man on Earth and one of the heaviest on Vortex 1214b. The heaviest on that planet would be 2,388 lbs which is the same as being over 600 lbs on Earth, which is considered morbidly obese.</p>
			<h2>Personality</h2>
			<p>When it comes to personality, this is where people on Earth can find Rambo somewhat relatable. He can be super nice, and from a blink of an eye, he can be a mindless predator. This supervillain is sneaky and detail oriented. He does prefer to be alone most times. He likes going at his own pace and doing the things he wants to do, although he tries to fit in and engage with others at times. He represents a villain due to him being destructive and careless at most times to people and objects, just to make him feel good. In the end, its all done to hide his insecurities and try to make himself less vulnerable.</p>
